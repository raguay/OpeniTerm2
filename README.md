## OpeniTerm2

Plugin for [fman.io](https://fman.io) to open the current directory in [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). This overrides the built-in function for opening the directory in Terminal. You can set a preference for always opening in a new tab or not. If you change the preference file, you have to reload fman to take effect.

Install with [fman's built-in command for installing plugins](https://fman.io/docs/installing-plugins).
